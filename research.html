          Everyone wants to change. Some people want to change fundamentally,

          The central thesis of my work is that
          <b
            >learning is a universal skill that must, in and of itself, be
            learned.</b
          >
          This <i>learning how to learn</i> is facilitated by metacognition,
          which learners use to direct, monitor, and evaluate their learning
          processes; in doing so, they improve their abilities to learn,
          tremendously.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to develop metacognition, learners must practice
          metacognitive skills while they learn. Many metacognitive skills are
          simple and familiar, e.g.:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>Making a plan of what to practice</i> is a metacognitive skill.
          </li>
          <li><i>Checking your work as you go</i> is a metacognitive skill.</li>
          <li><i>Journaling after you learn</i> is a metacognitive skill.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="red">
          Metacognition is an essential part of learning, but most learners
          <i>do not develop their metacognitive skills</i>, and therefore, do
          not learn how to learn, because:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Metacognitive skills must be practiced during learning.</li>
          <li><a href="/learning/is/hard">Learning is difficult.</a></li>
          <li class="therefore">
            And so, practicing metacognitive skills during learning makes
            learning
            <i>even more difficult.</i>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Put another way: learners only practice metacognitive skills when
          they're
          <i>also trying to learn something else</i>. As a result,
          <b
            >the choice to practice metacognitive skills is always positioned as
            an <i>extra burden on learning.</i></b
          >
        </p>
        <p class="green">
          It is sensible for learners to want to avoid this extra burden. To
          address this,
          <b
            >my work asks how we can reduce the cost of metacognitive practice
            in learning.</b
          >
        </p>

          I am interdisciplinary + practice-based. I design learning concepts,
          apply them to my own learning, and then communicate my findings using
          creative work. I am informed and inspired by
          <i>the learning sciences</i> (<abbr title='"learning by doing"'
            >constructionism</abbr
          >), <i>computer science</i>
          <abbr title='"user-interface design"'
            >(human-computer interaction)</abbr
          >, and <i>the creative arts</i> (<abbr
            title='"audio-visual storytelling"'
            >filmmaking</abbr
          >).

          Previously, I was a PhD student at Northwestern University as a member
          of Delta Lab, where I was co-advised by Haoqi Zhang and Nell O'Rourke
          under the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and Segal Design Research
          Cluster Fellowship; I voluntarily (and amicably) dropped out at the
          end of my third year.
